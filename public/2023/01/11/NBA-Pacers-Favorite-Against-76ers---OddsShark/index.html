        <h1 id="NBA-Pacers-Favorite-Against-76ers-OddsShark"><a href="#NBA-Pacers-Favorite-Against-76ers-OddsShark" class="headerlink" title="NBA Pacers Favorite Against 76ers - OddsShark"></a>NBA Pacers Favorite Against 76ers - OddsShark</h1><p>The Indiana Pacers are three-point favorites over the Philadelphia 76ers in Wednesday’s NBA betting action, according to odds provider OddsShark.</p>
<p>Indiana (33-25) comes into the matchup on a winning streak, having won its last six games. The Pacers are scoring 116.3 points per game during the streak while allowing just 104.8 points per game.</p>
<p>Philadelphia (25-34) is coming off a loss to the Houston Rockets and has now dropped nine of its last 10 games. The 76ers are scoring 107.1 points per game during that span but giving up 115.4 points per game.</p>
<p>Indiana has had success against Philly this season, winning both meetings by an average of 14 points per game. The Pacers are 5-2 against the spread in those games, while the 76ers are 2-5 ATS.</p>
<p>Seven of the last 10 head-to-head matchups between these teams have gone over the total, so betting the over may be a good option on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s NBA betting odds:</p>
<p>Indiana Pacers -3 (-110)<br>2½ (-115) Philadelphia 76ers</p>
<h1 id="NBA-betting-odds-Pacers-open-as-3-point-favorites-against-Rockets"><a href="#NBA-betting-odds-Pacers-open-as-3-point-favorites-against-Rockets" class="headerlink" title="NBA betting odds: Pacers open as 3-point favorites against Rockets"></a>NBA betting odds: Pacers open as 3-point favorites against Rockets</h1><p>The Indiana Pacers will open up as 3-point favorites when they take on the Houston Rockets in their opening round NBA Playoff matchup. The Rockets were one of the best teams in the NBA all season long, but they will now be playing without Chris Paul, who was injured in their final game of the regular season.</p>
<p>Houston had a very good season, but they may not be able to keep up with the Pacers without Chris Paul. Indiana was one of the most consistent teams in the NBA this season and they should be able to win this series fairly easily.</p>
<p>The Rockets are going to have a hard time winning this series without Chris Paul and I expect the Pacers to come out on top.</p>
<h1 id="Indiana-Pacers-Seeing-Modest-Betting-Action-As-Favorites-Against-Bulls"><a href="#Indiana-Pacers-Seeing-Modest-Betting-Action-As-Favorites-Against-Bulls" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Pacers Seeing Modest Betting Action As Favorites Against Bulls"></a>Indiana Pacers Seeing Modest Betting Action As Favorites Against Bulls</h1><p>The Indiana Pacers are seeing modest betting action as favorites against the Chicago Bulls, according to Sports Insights. </p>
<p>Indiana opened as 7.5-point favorites at most sportsbooks monitored by the SIA database, including 5Dimes, BetOnline, and Bovada. The line has since shifted to Pacers -8.5 at most books, with a few offering -9. </p>
<p>It’s not surprising to see the Pacers heavily favored in this matchup. They come into Wednesday’s game with a 30-18 record — good for third place in the Eastern Conference standings — while the Bulls have just 18 wins on the season. </p>
<p>Chicago has lost six of its last seven games overall and is just 2-10 ATS in its last 12 contests. The Bulls did cover the spread in their last meeting with Indiana, but they’re still 6-11 ATS in their last 17 meetings with the Pacers overall. </p>
<p>Given those trends and Indiana’s current form (eight wins in their last 10 games), backing the Pacers looked like a safe bet on Wednesday night.</p>
<h1 id="NBA-playoffs-Pacers-a-4-point-favorite-over-Hawks-in-Game-1"><a href="#NBA-playoffs-Pacers-a-4-point-favorite-over-Hawks-in-Game-1" class="headerlink" title="NBA playoffs: Pacers a 4-point favorite over Hawks in Game 1"></a>NBA playoffs: Pacers a 4-point favorite over Hawks in Game 1</h1><p>Odds are in the Pacers favor as they enter their first round NBA playoff matchup against the Hawks. Indiana is favored by 4 points with a money line of -200 in Game 1, according to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.mybookie.ag/sports/basketball/">MyBookie</a>.</p>
<p>Atlanta had a good season but was ultimately outclassed by the Pacers. Indiana finished with a 48-34 record while Atlanta was just above .500 at 43-39. The Hawks also struggled against top teams, going just 7-12 against playoff teams this year.</p>
<p>Pacers star Victor Oladipo has been on fire lately and is looking to lead his team deep into the playoffs. Oladipo averaged 23 points, 5 rebounds, and 4 assists per game this year and has been even better in recent months. He scored 30 or more points in six of his last 11 games and will be looking to exploit Atlanta’s defense.</p>
<p>The Hawks have several players who can score, but no one who can match Oladipo’s production. Dennis Schroder led the team in scoring at 19 points per game, but he will need help from players like Taurean Prince and John Collins if they want to stay competitive in this series.</p>
<p>Indiana was one of the best defensive teams in the NBA this year, allowing just 105.3 points per game. They should be able to slow down Schroder and company, making them difficult to beat in a seven game series.</p>
<p>The Pacers are also strong offensively, averaging 111.8 points per game this year. Shooting guard Lance Stephenson has been playing well lately and is a big reason for their success offensively. With Oladipo and Stephenson both leading the way, Indiana looks like they could go far in the playoffs this year.</p>
<h1 id="Indiana-Pacers-4-point-favorites-against-Toronto-Raptors-in-NBA-Playoffs"><a href="#Indiana-Pacers-4-point-favorites-against-Toronto-Raptors-in-NBA-Playoffs" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Pacers 4-point favorites against Toronto Raptors in NBA Playoffs"></a>Indiana Pacers 4-point favorites against Toronto Raptors in NBA Playoffs</h1><p>The Pacers will look to take a 2-1 series lead when they host the Toronto Raptors as 4-point favorites at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com on Sunday.</p>
<p> Indiana won the opening game of this best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal matchup by a score of 92-90, and it has been a mostly back-and-forth affair since with three games decided by three points or fewer. The Raptors were 3.5-point favorites in their Game 2 loss on Thursday night and failed to cover the spread for just the second time in their last nine away from home.</p>
<p>While both teams have proved evenly matched so far, Toronto has not been great against the spread as a road underdog, going just 8-10 ATS in its last 18 tries in that role, while the Pacers are 5-1 ATS in their last six games as home favorites of three points or less.</p>
<p>Toronto averaged 114 points per game during the regular season, fifth most in the NBA, but it has been held to 100 or fewer points in each of its two playoff games against Indiana. The Raptors shot just 36 percent from the field in Thursday’s loss after hitting at least 50 percent of their shots in seven of their last eight contests overall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pacers have relied heavily on guard Victor Oladipo, who is averaging 27.5 points per game so far this series. He was limited to 16 points on 5-of-19 shooting in Game 2 but still came up with the go-ahead layup with five seconds remaining. Second-year center Myles Turner has also stepped up for Indiana with averages of 15 points and 7 rebounds after recording just 6.7 points and 4 rebounds during the regular season.</p>
<p>The Pacers are hoping to avoid another second-round exit after losing to Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games last year, while Toronto is looking to make its first conference finals appearance since 2016 when it lost to LeBron James and eventual champion Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>
