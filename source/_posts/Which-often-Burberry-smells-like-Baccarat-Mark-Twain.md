In 1879, Burberry invented gabardine; a breathable, waterproof fabric which could be produced in various colours and used to make trench coats for soldiers during World War I. The fabric was also adopted by civilians as the "classic raincoat" and remains one of the brand's most popular products.

Today, Burberry is a global luxury fashion house with over 500 stores around the world. It has revenue of $2.7 billion and employs over 10,000 people.

The pattern is made up of two inverted T-shaped designs which are intersected by a single horizontal line. It was originally used as a lining for coats but has since been integrated into almost every aspect of the brand's product range.
