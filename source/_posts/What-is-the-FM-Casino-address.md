#  What is the FM Casino address?

The FM Casino address is 9595 Falls of Neuse Rd #21, Raleigh, NC 27615.

#  What FM Casino games can be played?

There are a range of casino games that can be played on the Football Manager (FM) game engine. These include different types of casino poker, blackjack, roulette and baccarat. The following is a guide to the different types of FM casino games that are available, as well as how to play them.

## Casino Poker

Casino poker is one of the most popular FM casino games. There are a variety of different variations of the game that can be played, including Texas Hold’Em, Omaha and Five Card Draw. In order to play casino poker, the player first needs to select the ‘Casino Games’ tab in the main FM menu. This will then open up a list of different casino games that can be played. The player then needs to select ‘Poker’ from this list in order to begin playing.

Once in the poker window, the player will need to select which variation of the game they want to play from the list on the left-hand side of the screen. They can then choose how many players they want to play against by selecting either 1, 2 or 3 players on the right-hand side of the screen. The player can then press ‘New Game’ at the bottom of the screen in order to begin playing.

In casino poker, each player is dealt two cards face down and five cards face up. The aim of the game is to create the best five-card hand possible using any combination of these seven cards. The player can use any three of their face-up cards and any two of their face-down cards to create their hand. The player starts by placing a bet, and then has two options: either betting again or folding their hand. If they choose to bet again, they must raise at least double their original bet amount. If they fold their hand, they lose all money that they have put into the pot so far.

The players continue betting in this way until either all but one player has folded or everyone has placed the same amount into the pot (called ‘calling’). Once this happens, all players show their cards and whoever has the best hand wins all money that is in the pot (including money from previous rounds). If two or more players have equally good hands, then the pot is divided equally between them.

## Blackjack

Blackjack is another popular FM casino game. In blackjack, each player is dealt two cards face up and one card face down (the ‘hole card’). The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21 points. In order to do this, players can either hit (take another card) or stand (stop taking cards). If they go over 21 points, they bust and automatically lose regardless of what else happens in the game.

The dealer also starts with two cards – one face up and one face down. However, unlike with players, dealers must hit if they have 16 points or less – otherwise they bust just like players do if they go over 21 points. As soon as both dealer and player have finished playing their hands, whoever has more points than the other wins – even if it’s not 21! In cases where both dealer and player have equal points (a ‘push’), no one wins or loses money – except for anyone who may have placed bets on a tie happening (these pay out at 8:1 odds).

In blackjack, players can place bets on a variety of different things apart from simply whether they will win or lose against dealer – for example whether both dealer’s first two cards will be pairs or whether there will be at least one ace in dealer’s final hand etc.. To see a full list of all available bets and their odds for any given blackjack game round, pressing F10 on your keyboard whilst in-game will bring up a help box which explains everything in detail!

## Roulette

Roulette is another classic FM casino game that many people enjoy playing. In roulette, each player bets on where they think a ball randomly chosen from a spinning wheel will end up landing after bouncing around inside.. There are 38 possible places for it to end up (numbered 0-36), meaning that there is roughly a 1 in 38 chance for any given bet to win! Different types of bets offer different odds though – so it’s important for players to familiarise themselves with all available options before placing any bets! Bets can be placed by clicking on chips worth 1 chip through 100 chips at table minimum and maximum limits - which are located near bottom right side corner below Roulette Board

      Clicking 'Clear All Bets' removes all active bets - while clicking Dealer's Button reveals winning combinations & payout odds when ball falls into coloured slots
