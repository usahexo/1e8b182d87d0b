#  How To Win At Roulette: Tips From The Pros 

If you're ready to up your roulette strategy game, you're in luck. We've scoured the internet for the best tips from the pros to help you start winning more often.

1. Choose a table with lower odds: This may seem counterintuitive, but it's actually a good strategy. When the odds are lower, the house edge is lower, which means you have a better chance of winning.

2. Know the basics: There's no need to overcomplicate things--just know the basic rules of roulette and how to place your bets properly. This will give you a solid foundation on which to build your strategy.

3. Don't bet on red or black: These are two of the most popular bets, but they're also two of the worst ones. The odds are evens for both of these bets, so your chances of winning are 50-50. Instead, try betting on specific numbers or combinations of numbers.

4. Use outside bets: Outside bets are those that cover large sections of the wheel, such as red or black, odd or even, and high or low numbers. They have better odds than individual number bets, so they're a safer option if you're not confident in your strategy.

5. Avoid progressive betting systems: These systems may seem like a surefire way to win big, but they actually have some of the worst odds in roulette. Stick to simpler strategies instead and save yourself from risking too much money.

6. Plan ahead: Like any other casino game, roulette requires some strategy and planning if you want to come out ahead. Make sure you know what bets you want to make before the game starts and don't get swayed by gut feelings or lucky guesses.
