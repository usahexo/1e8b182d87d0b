Hollywood Casino in Dayton Ohio Closes its Doors
Pennsylvania-based gaming company, Penn National Gaming, has announced that it will be closing the Hollywood Casino in Dayton, Ohio. The shutdown is expected to happen by the end of this year.

The closure of Hollywood Casino will leave nearly 700 employees without a job. This news comes as a great shock to the community, as the casino has been a staple in the area for over two decades.

In a statement released by Penn National Gaming, the company said that the closure is due to “recent macroeconomic headwinds affecting consumer spending”. It was also mentioned that the casino has not been generating enough revenue to be profitable in recent years.

This closure is just one of many happening within the gaming industry. Recently, both Atlantic City and Biloxi casinos have closed their doors. The Atlantic City closures left over 3,000 employees out of work, while the Biloxi closures left 1,600 employees without a job.

The gaming industry is facing a lot of competition from other forms of entertainment, such as online gambling and esports. In addition, many states are now allowing people to gamble online, which has taken away some of the business from brick-and-mortar casinos.

#  600 Employees Lose their Jobs as Hollywood Casino Closes its Doors

After 37 years in business, the Hollywood Casino in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, closed its doors for good on January 15th. The casino had been struggling financially for some time and had been in the process of filing for bankruptcy when the final decision was made to close. Nearly 600 employees lost their jobs as a result of the closure.

The Hollywood Casino opened in 1981 and was one of the first casinos in Indiana. It quickly became a popular destination for gamblers in the Midwest, but its popularity began to decline in recent years as other casinos opened in the area. The casino had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2018, but it was not enough to save it from closure.

In a statement released by parent company Penn National Gaming, they said that they were “disappointed to announce this difficult decision which we do not take lightly”. They went on to say that they were exploring opportunities to reopen the casino in the future, but there is no guarantee that will happen.

The closure of the Hollywood Casino has left many employees scrambling to find new jobs. Some have already found new positions, but others are still searching. The community of Lawrenceburg is also feeling the impact of the closure, as many people frequented the casino for entertainment and dining options.

It is unclear what will happen to the property now that the casino is closed. Penn National Gaming has not announced any plans for it yet.

#  Hollywood Casino in Dayton Ohio to Close Sometime this Month

The Hollywood Casino in Dayton, Ohio is set to close sometime this month. It’s one of the four casinos that were authorized to operate in the state, and it’s the only one located outside of Columbus or Cleveland. The other three are in downtown areas, while the Hollywood Casino is located in the suburbs.

The casino has been struggling financially for a few years now. In 2016, its revenue was down by $16 million from the year before. This decline was largely due to competition from casinos in other states. In 2017, the casino’s revenue continued to decline, and it was eventually decided that it would close down.

Some people are sad to see the casino close because it provided jobs and entertainment for the community. But others say that it was inevitable, given the competition from other states. Whatever people’s opinions may be, it’s clear that the closure of the Hollywood Casino will have a significant impact on Dayton.

#  Hollywood Casino in Dayton Ohio to Close after Only a Year of Operation

Hollywood Casino in Dayton Ohio is set to close after only a year of operation. The casino, which is owned by Penn National Gaming, has failed to turn a profit and will now be shut down. This news comes as a surprise to many, as the casino had been expected to be very successful.

The closure of Hollywood Casino will leave nearly 300 employees without jobs. It is unclear what will happen to the property, but Penn National Gaming has stated that it intends to sell the casino.

This closure is just the latest in a string of bad news for the gambling industry. In recent months, several other casinos have closed their doors, including the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City and the Trump Taj Mahal.

Many experts believe that the casino industry is in trouble due to increasing competition from online gambling sites. Additionally, there has been a slowdown in consumer spending, which has affected casinos across the country.

The closure of Hollywood Casino is sure to be a disappointment for Dayton residents, who were looking forward to having a major gambling destination in their city. However, there are still several other casinos located nearby, including the Horseshoe Casino in Cincinnati and the Hollywood Casino in Columbus.

#  Gaming Commission Investigates Hollywood Casino Closure

The Pennsylvania Gaming Commission has announced that it will investigate the closure of Hollywood Casino in Grantville. The casino abruptly closed its doors last week, leaving over 1,000 employees without work.

Commission chairman Greg Fajt said that the investigation will focus on the circumstances leading up to the closure and whether or not the casino violated any state regulations. "We are committed to ensuring that all gaming operators in Pennsylvania operate in a responsible and lawful manner," Fajt said in a statement.

In a letter to the commission, Hollywood Casino's parent company, Gaming and Leisure Properties, said that the closure was due to "a lack of financial performance." However, some employees have alleged that the casino was shut down in order to make way for a new development project.

"My husband has worked at Hollywood Casino for six years and he just lost his job," said Donna McFadden, who attended Wednesday's commission meeting. "We have two kids and we're really worried about what's going to happen now."

The commission has asked Hollywood Casino's executives to appear at a hearing next month to answer questions about the closure.
