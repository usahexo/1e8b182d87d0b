#  Islamic clerics debate if online games like poker are haram

Islamic clerics have been debating for years if online games like poker are haram. Some say that because it involves gambling, it is not allowed. Others say that as long as the games are played for fun and not for profit, then they are permissible. Still others argue that poker is a skill game, and therefore is allowed.

The debate over whether or not online poker is haram has been heating up in recent months, as several Muslim countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia, have begun to crackdown on the game. In February, the Malaysian government announced that it would be banning all online poker games, and anyone caught playing them could face imprisonment or a fine.

This move by the Malaysian government was met with criticism by some Islamic clerics, who argued that the ban was unnecessary and that the game could be played safely and responsibly. Others argued that poker is a skill game and therefore should be allowed.

The Indonesian government has also taken steps to crack down on online poker. In March, the Indonesian Ministry of Communications announced that it would be blocking all websites hosting online poker games. The ministry said that the move was necessary in order to protect Indonesian citizens from gambling addiction.

The debate over whether or not online poker is haram is likely to continue into the future. Some Islamic clerics argue that the game is sinful because it involves gambling, while others argue that it can be safely played if done in moderation.

#  Malaysian mufti declares online gambling as haram

Recently, the Malaysian mufti declared online gambling as haram. This is a landmark decision as online gambling is becoming increasingly popular, especially in Malaysia.

 GAMBLING IS HARAM

The mufti, or chief Islamic legal advisor, declared that online gambling is prohibited under Islamic law. He said that the practice is sinful and harmful to society. He also urged the Malaysian government to do more to crackdown on online gambling.

The Malaysian mufti's decision is significant because it provides religious justification for opposing online gambling. It will likely be used by the Malaysian government as a rationale for further clamping down on the industry.

THE DANGERS OF ONLINE GAMBLING

Online gambling can be dangerous because it can lead to addiction and financial ruin. It can also be used to launder money and finance terrorism.

In Malaysia, there are concerns that online gambling is contributing to social problems such as debt, family breakdowns, and crime. There have been reports of people losing their life savings through online gambling.

THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF ONLINE GAMBLING

Online gambling is a huge industry and it has a major impact on the economy. In Malaysia, it is estimated that the industry is worth billions of dollars. It employs thousands of people and generates significant tax revenue for the government.

The mufti's declaration that online gambling is haram will likely have a negative impact on the industry. It may dissuade some people from gambling online and could lead to a decline in revenue for the government.

#  Indonesian Ulema council rules online gaming as forbidden under Islamic law

On Tuesday, the Indonesian Ulema council (MUI) ruled that online gaming is forbidden under Islamic law. This decision makes Indonesia the latest Muslim-majority country to ban online gaming, following in the footsteps of countries like Malaysia and Qatar.

The MUI issued the fatwa (religious ruling) after months of study and deliberation on the matter. Council members determined that playing online games constituted “gambling”, which is forbidden under Islamic law. They also ruled that online gaming could lead to addiction and social isolation.

Indonesia is a secular country, with a population that is 88% Muslim. However, this ruling from the MUI will likely have a significant impact on Indonesian society nonetheless. In recent years, there has been a surge in popularity of online gaming in Indonesia, especially among young people.

The Indonesian government has not yet commented on the MUI’s ruling. However, it is likely that they will enforce the ban in some way, as they have done with previous rulings from the council. In 2016, for example, the government blocked access to several popular streaming websites after the MUI issued a fatwa against them.

#  Gambling through online games is 'haram,' says Brunei government religious affairs official

The Brunei government religious affairs official has said that gambling through online games is “haram”, essentially making it forbidden under Muslim law.

In a statement, Awg Haji Abdul Malik bin Pengarah Dato Paduka Haji Awg MohdAccessory
 Tusni bin Pengarah Dato Paduka Haji said that any form of gambling is prohibited in Islam, including activities such as online casino games and betting on football matches.

He urged the public to not participate in such activities, warning that those who do could face punishment under Islamic law, which can include jail time and fines.

This is the latest move by the Brunei government to crackdown on what it deems to be illicit behavior. In April of last year, the country announced a new penal code which would see those convicted of adultery, homosexuality and abortion facing stoning to death. The international community reacted with outrage, with celebrities such as George Clooney and Elton John speaking out against the proposed legislation.

While Brunei has not yet implemented the death penalty for those convicted of homosexuality or adultery, there have been reports of people being arrested and punished under the new code.

#  Singapore's top Islamic authority: Online gaming including poker is not permissible

The Fatwa Committee of Singapore’s top Islamic authority, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) has released a statement saying that online gaming including poker is not permissible.

In the statement, the MUIS said it considered a number of factors in reaching its decision, including whether the games were based on chance or skill, and their effects on mental and physical health. It added that while some forms of gambling may be permissible, Muslims should avoid all forms of gambling “due to its high risks and potential for addiction”.

This ruling by MUIS is likely to come as a disappointment to the many Muslim gamers in Singapore who enjoy playing poker and other casino games online. However, it is in line with similar rulings by other Islamic authorities around the world.

For example, in January this year, the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) issued a fatwa banning online poker and other casino games, declaring them “ haram” (forbidden). The MUI based its ruling on the grounds that such games were based on chance rather than skill, and could lead to financial losses and other problems for players.

Similarly, in 2016 an Egyptian mufti declared online poker haram due to its links to gambling and speculation. And in 2013 an Iraqi council of religious scholars ruled that all forms of online gaming are forbidden under Islam.

So it appears that Singapore’s MUIS is following a growing global trend towards deeming online gaming including poker as being not permissible under Islamic law.
