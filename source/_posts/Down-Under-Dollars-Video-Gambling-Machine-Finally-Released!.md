Make sure you use them wisely as they can help boost your bank balance significantly.'  * Take advantage of bonuses - Most online casinos offer bonuses for signing up or making deposits so be sure to take advantage of them!  * Stay calm - One of the biggest mistakes gamblers make is getting carried away and becoming emotional about their bets.
