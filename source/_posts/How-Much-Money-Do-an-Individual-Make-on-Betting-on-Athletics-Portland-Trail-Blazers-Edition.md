#  How Much Money Do an Individual Make on Betting on Athletics: Portland Trail Blazers Edition

In this article, we will take a look at the amount of money that can be made by betting on the Portland Trail Blazers. As always, we will start by taking a look at the odds for each game.

We should start off by saying that the Blazers are not favored in any of their games. In fact, they are currently listed as 10-point underdogs against the Golden State Warriors. This means that if you were to bet $100 on the Blazers, you would only win $10 if they were to pull off the upset.

However, there are some matchups where the Blazers are slight favorites. For example, they are listed as 2.5-point favorites against the Oklahoma City Thunder and 1-point favorites against the Minnesota Timberwolves. In both of these matchups, a bet on the Blazers would pay out $115 for every $100 wagered if they were to win.

So, is it worth betting on the Blazers?

Well, that all depends on how confident you are in their ability to win. If you think they have a good chance of winning, then betting on them would be a wise decision. However, if you think they are going to lose big against teams like Golden State and Houston, then it may be best to stay away from betting on them altogether.
